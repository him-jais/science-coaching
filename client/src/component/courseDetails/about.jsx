                <p>Science Circle was created in 2018 in the vision  of Abhishek 
                    Sundaram, a post graduate Sfrom IIT-Dhanbad. We had a very 
                    humble beginning as a forum for 8th to 12th classes, with a
                    vision to provide an ideal launch pad for serious aspirants.
                    We actually started to make a difference in the way Students
                    think and approach problems. We started to develop ways to enhance
                    Studentâ€™s IQ. Science Circle has embarked upon a mission that 
                    envisions  of education through its services from classes 8th 
                    to 12th. We are now catering to the need of a student throughout 
                    its academic cycle. We are here to shape the career of the student,
                    a complete educational hub - School Education  from 8th to 12th.
